  <h3>About</h3>
  <h4>space for mature developers</h4>
  <h4 class="opacity-75 m-6">I just turned 50 years old. I remember my first steps in using a computer. It was an ATARI 130 XE computer with no disk drive and no Internet access, connected to a TV set. Only the keyboard and a manual with BASIC basics and a few examples to enter and run. How much fun it was when the script entered after the start worked, but unfortunately disappeared with the shutdown of ATARI. Who remembers it? Today programming looks quite different, although many rules are still valid. I create this space to present myself as a fairly mature man but also newly starting his adventure as a programmer and publish helpful materials from the perspective of such a man.</h4>
