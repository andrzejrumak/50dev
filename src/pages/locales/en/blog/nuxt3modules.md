# Nuxt 3 modules

After about 2 weeks after the release of Nuxt 3 in beta public work on the project itself, the documentation is developed to announce the stable version - ready for production after some time.

An important part of its development are modules that can be installed and used in Nuxt3.


## Modules gives us new functionality

Modules are libraries of services, functionalities that can be easily integrated with the framework and used in a simple way.
Modules enrich frameworkwork and give you possibility to use what is already tested and working in development.
As I wrote earlier about starters, it allows you to shorten development time, use ready patterns and solutions.

## Nuxt 2 moduls that I use

Personally, in Nuxt 2 I used, among other things 

- i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/i18n-module) module for internationalization.
- content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for simple access to content and data created in Markdown, JSON, YAML, XML and CSV files via a MongoDB-like API.
- axsios](https://axios.nuxtjs.org/) module for Nuxt based on the http client library for browsers and node js.
- tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/) increasingly used and developed utility first css framework.

I present only 4 of 172 modules created for Nuxt 2.

 Full list can be found at [modules.nuxt.org](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/)


## Nuxt 3 Type Script modules 

Nuxt 3 was written in Type Script, which gives us a lot of advantages in modern coding and web application development. Also, modules to take full advantage of TS should be written in TS. Therefore, the fastest were created  those that are fairly fresh. 

Listed below:

- [nuxt-windicss](https://github.com/windicss/nuxt-windicss) a module for another utility first css framework compatible with the previously mentioned tailwind css.
- [piny/nuxt](https://pinia.esm.dev) module that allows us to create and manage a store for Vue in an intuitive, type-safe way, with access to DevTools in the browser.
- [primevue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) module integrating Nuxt 3 UI component library for Vue.

## We are all waiting for next modules

Looking at the number of modules for Nuxt 2 and the huge possibilities they give us in terms of DX (DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE) we expect that most of them will be implemented into Nuxt 3 as soon as possible. This is also one of the elements of announcing a stable version of Nuxt 3.

Below is a link to a page where the status of its readiness for use in Nuxt 3 is published on an ongoing basis.
