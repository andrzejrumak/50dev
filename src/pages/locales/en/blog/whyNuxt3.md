# Why I am waiting for Nuxt3?
The third version of the Nuxt famework has been expected for over a year now. Is it worth to wait?

## NuxtNation

At the first [NuxtNation](https://nuxtnation.com/) conference and on its first day, memorable for me because I was 50 years old at the time, the public beta date for Nuxt3 was announced.

October 12, 2021 is the date the beta will be available to everyone. At the conference these many details about the new version were given.

## What's new?

Nuxt3 has been built from the ground up as a foundation for modern webdevelopment as a hybrid of static and server-side rendering with API routes and native built-in serverless functions.

Nuxt 3 has been redesigned in terms of its architecture, it's smaller and optimized for fast performance, and more convenient to web development.

## What new features does it have?
