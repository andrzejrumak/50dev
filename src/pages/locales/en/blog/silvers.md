# Silvers

Can a person over fifty be a good employee?

## Who are silvers?

"Silvers" people who are over the age of 50. The term comes from the color of their hair, which turns silver with the time passing by.
 It's the name of a generation that is increasingly common in the context of the job market. 
The term is a milder version of "senior", with which the image of a pensioner in a rocking chair is associated. 
As opposed to "seniors" (retirees). (not in the senior dev concept, of course), "silvers" are economically active people. 

## Positive traits

The distinguishing features of such people include:

- professional (30 years) and life experience
- responsibility, because their roots go back to quite different times
- dedication and loyalty
- stability in private life
- openness and readiness to share knowledge and experience with younger employees 


## Silvers are increasingly in demand on the labor market

According to Agnieszka Surowiec (HR Director at Intrum), "employers are eagerly looking for silvers because they have at least thirty years of professional experience, and this value cannot be overestimated. In addition, there are characteristics, such as consistency in action, ability to organize working time and self-control, which young people lack. Employees over 50 also have the advantage of responsibility and commitment (which is, among others, the result of a stable family life). This is confirmed by the research of Pracuj.pl - it shows that employers in silvers value a high level of work performed (58 percent), openness and willingness to share knowledge and experience with younger employees (57 percent), significant loyalty to current employers (54 percent)."

## Poland

Global organization PwC defines the situation of silvers in Poland as follows:

"Poland still ranks 30th out of 35 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in PwC's Golden Age Index, which assesses the level of utilization of the potential of people over 55 in the labor market. According to the estimates of PwC experts, increasing the economic activity of this group to the level of countries on the podium of the list, in the long run, would bring Poland an increase in GDP of up to $66 billion."

A good example is New Zealand, where the employment rate of people over 55 was 76.1% in 2016.


So all is near ahead of us when it comes to our country. What about situation in your country?



## Encouragement

If you're over 50 don't give up on your dreams, don't be afraid to change your life and career - it's just beginning.

I personally started learning programming again after the age of 46. Today, when I turned 50 I have more and more experience and satisfaction in it.
