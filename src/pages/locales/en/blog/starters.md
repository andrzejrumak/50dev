# Starters for Nuxt 3

They say "don't reinvent the wheel" or "don't break down open doors" but as long as it's allowed use ready-made solutions.

Good, open source starters are a good start to the project but also a good source to learn from. 

Open source starters, which can be found on Github, are the result of the work of programmers who have already worked out some issues that we do not have to go through.
So, a big thank you to the open source developers.

When it comes to Nuxt 3, which is still in beta and at the beginning there are not yet many tutorials, youtube videos and full documentation I'm glad that they are prepared.

Below is one of the starters, which gives us Nuxt 3 beta with Tailwind and Pinia - state manager - younger brother of Vuex.

I will also mention my attempts to create a starter, which I will be developing and I believe will shorten the time of entering a new project with Nuxt 3

By the way a awesome starter I used to create this site.

What more do you need for startup?

Or maybe you know some interesting starters?
